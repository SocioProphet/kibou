# Kibou

## What is Kibou?
Kibou is a lightweight federated social networking server based on open protocols. It is
written in Rust, utilizes Rocket as it's web framework and Diesel as it's database driver.

**Notice**: Kibou is *not* considered stable yet. This project's development is still
work-in-progress. Using the development branch is not recommended for production usage.

## Federation with other software
Federation is known to work with Pleroma and Mastodon, which are also the main
projects we are testing against right now. But other implementations should work as well.
