# Kibou

## What is Kibou?
Kibou is a lightweight federated social networking server based on open protocols. It is
written in Rust, utilizes Rocket as it's web framework and Diesel as it's database driver.

The project's objective is to provide a highly customizable multi-protocol social networking server. Currently supported is the commonly used [ActivtyPub](https://activitypub.rocks) protocol.

**Notice**: Kibou is *not* considered stable yet. This project's development is still
work-in-progress. Using the development branch is not recommended for production usage.

## Federation with other software
Federation is known to work with [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), [Misskey](https://joinmisskey.github.io) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) which are also the main projects being tested against. But other implementations should work as well.
